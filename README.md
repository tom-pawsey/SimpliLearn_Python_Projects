# SimpliLearn_Python_Projects

This is where I will be posting any Python projects undertaken whilst completing my SimpliLearn course.

The first project completed uses App data from the Google Play Store. This data was analysed, cleaned, and then used linear regression to calculate r2 values on train and test sets. The task instructions and the code can be found on 'Project 1 - App Store Analysis', and the data used on the 'googleplaystore' csv file.
